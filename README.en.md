Clash Compatibility Monitor keeps a working node in place, performs conservative failover after confirmed failures, and avoids blaming a node when the same service fails across the current node and two recently verified standbys.

## Why use it

- Discovers actual leaf nodes from `proxies`, `proxy-providers`, and mixed subscription layouts without relying on region names.
- Always checks ChatGPT and Gemini together, with optional Google, GitHub, Steam, Discord, Spotify, Epic, and Z-Library web checks.
- The local v0.7.0-preview.5 build treats ChatGPT and Gemini as a fixed core and admits candidates only when their actual exit is in the ChatGPT and Gemini official supported-region intersection. After an explicit current-node failure, all leaf-node Mihomo delays are measured concurrently; up to eight nodes are inspected in live-delay order, scanning stops after the three lowest-latency eligible candidates are found, and real-service P75 ranks the fully validated target and fallbacks. Healthy connections are checked automatically every 60 seconds, while failures and post-switch observation use 30-second intervals. This cannot guarantee account sign-in or AI generation and is not a formal GitHub release.
- Requires five observations spanning at least 30 minutes with a success rate of 95% or higher before a performance-only switch.
- Keeps two recent standbys, observes every automatic switch, and can safely roll back.
- Does not modify Clash configuration files, take ownership of subscriptions, inspect browser history, or upload telemetry.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Clash Verge Rev with a Mihomo core; the primary development environment uses Clash Verge Rev 2.4.5
- An existing working subscription; this project does not provide proxy nodes

## Quick start

1. Download and extract the complete package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tejamanilannya593-arch/clash-compat-monitor/releases/latest).
2. Enable `clash/enhancement.js` as a Clash Verge Rev JavaScript enhancement, apply the configuration, and run `Diagnose.cmd`.
3. Run `Install.cmd`, choose the services you use, and leave the monitor running in the Windows tray.

The installer only selects nodes in the generated proxy group. It does not edit subscription files or restart Clash. See the [Chinese quick-start guide](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup and troubleshooting.

## Evidence boundaries

The monitor separates entry reachability from login-chain network evidence. For ChatGPT and Gemini it checks the application entry and official authentication infrastructure; a challenge page alone is not full compatibility. It does not operate your browser account and cannot prove actual model generation or an ongoing conversation.

Anonymous probes and displayed HTTP latency still cannot measure actual model-generation latency or guarantee future account behavior. Browser proof checks the website, not API-key calls. Sign-in prompts, CAPTCHAs, security challenges, and unsupported page layouts are reported separately and are not attributed to the node. Automatic retries after a failed conversation have a six-hour cooldown; a user-triggered retry does not. Performance optimization of an otherwise healthy node is off by default. If explicitly enabled, a performance-only AI switch requires strict probe evidence, fresh conversation proof for the selected AI services, five history observations spanning 30 minutes at 95% success or better, a five-sample median at or below 800 ms, no sample or selected-service response above 1500 ms, and jitter at or below 150 ms.

Steam game traffic and downloads continue to follow the user's existing Clash direct-routing rules.

## Privacy and security

The application runs locally and uploads no telemetry. Do not post subscription URLs, controller secrets, full Clash configuration files, full logs, or `experience.json` in public issues. Use the repository's private Security Advisory flow for vulnerabilities; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Build and test

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1
node .\clash\enhancement.test.js
node .\browser-extension\tests\run.js
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tests\Release.Tests.ps1
```
